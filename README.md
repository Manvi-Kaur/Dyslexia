# Dyslexia
Machine Learning Model to detect Dyslexia
In this project, we have created a Machine Learning model to predict Dyslexia. 
In the DyslexiaML file, we have created 5 models using DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, SVM, RandomForest with GridSearchCV and SVM with GridSearchCV. These models have then been compared on the basis of precision and reacall to find the best fit for our data. It was found to the RandomForestClassifier with GridSearchCV. 
Following the above result, the DyslexiaML_final file was created, using the RandomForestClassifier with GridSearchCV. This model is then used in the final application in order to make predictions on the basis of survery score.
